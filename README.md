## About <a name = "about"></a>
Website about recipes. People will be able to find new recipes and add their own delicious recipes here. They will also be able to rate them with stars. It is made with Tailwind and responsive for mobile and desktop. Design was made in Figma

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Figma https://www.figma.com/downloads/
Visual Studio Code (or some code editor for changing and viewing code) https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com/download/
Xampp or a live server (NEOSERV for example) https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Install all Prerequisites

```
You download all the programms through the links I gave in Prerequisites and register in them, if you haven't before.
```

Pulling the files

```
You pull these files in GitHub Desktop and open them in your Visual Studio code to edit and view
```

Extracting the files

```
You extract these files into your server.
The Recepti.SQL is code for database, which you import into your database in your server.
In the FigmaLink.md you can find my Figma design, from which is this website based on.
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To access the full website, you access it through your server on which everything should work, if you followed the instructions. To view and edit code from the website, you can edit it in the server or VS Code. If you edit it in either, you have to copy it to the other and save on both, so they are the same. In Figma you can also edit the design and get the code through plugin Figma to Code, which is in Dev mode in Figma. There you select the Tailwind option, because this code is using tailwind styling. 
Hope you will be able to access the code and use it :)
